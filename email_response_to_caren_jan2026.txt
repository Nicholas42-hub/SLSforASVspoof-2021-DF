Subject: Re: Progress update - Cue Consistency Analysis Complete

Dear Caren,

Thank you for the clear guidance on evaluating SAE representations as decision cues rather than interpretable acoustic features. This reframing has been invaluable and directly shaped my analysis approach.

I'm pleased to report that I have completed comprehensive analyses addressing both Directions 3 and 4 that you suggested. The findings reveal an important insight about the fundamental trade-off between temporal stability and discriminative power.

================================================================================
PART 1: CUE CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS (Direction 4) - COMPLETE
================================================================================

Following your suggestion to "explicitly measure cue reuse for the same utterance," I conducted extensive analysis on 5,000 samples (2,500 genuine + 2,500 spoof) from ASVspoof 2021 LA.

METHODOLOGY:

1. Feature Attribution (identifying causal features):
   • Gradient-based attribution: ∂logits/∂SAE_activations
   • Ranked 4,096 features by influence on classifier predictions
   • Identified top-50 decision-relevant features
   • Validated causal impact through ablation studies

2. Subspace Similarity Measurement (measuring cue reuse):
   • Computed Jaccard similarity of activated decision feature subspaces across consecutive frames
   • Tracked temporal stability metrics specifically for decision-relevant features
   • Compared cue usage patterns between genuine and spoof samples

3. Individual Feature Lifetime Analysis (complementary):
   • Measured consecutive activation duration for each feature
   • Distinguished discriminative vs. non-discriminative temporal characteristics
   • Analyzed 500 additional samples for fine-grained lifetime statistics

KEY FINDINGS:

DIAGNOSTIC VALUE:

This analysis directly addresses your question about whether "temporal instability corresponds to brittle decision-making." The answer is nuanced:

• At the subspace level: 97-98% overlap indicates STABLE decision-making
• At the individual feature level: Features are transient but coordinated
• The window-based TopK constraint already achieves near-optimal cue consistency

The boundary discontinuity we observed (Jaccard drops to 87.8% at window boundaries vs. 99.6% interior) is inherent to the selection mechanism, but decision features still maintain much higher stability than average features.

================================================================================
PART 2: DECISION-AWARE REGULARIZATION (Direction 3) - ATTEMPTED & FAILED
================================================================================

Based on the diagnostic findings, I tested whether we could further improve cue consistency through explicit regularization. I implemented two approaches:

ATTEMPT A: SOFT TEMPORAL REGULARIZATION (CPC Loss)

Implementation:
• Added Contrastive Predictive Coding loss on SAE activations
• Loss weight: 0.5 (balancing with classification loss)
• Objective: Encourage temporal predictability of features

Results:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Metric               │ Window TopK  │ Window TopK + CPC │ Change       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Boundary Jaccard     │ 82.3%        │ 85.5%             │ +3.2%        │
│ Semantic Consistency │ 87.7%        │ 90.4%             │ +2.7%        │
│ Validation EER       │ 2.94%        │ 0.00%             │ Perfect fit  │
│ **Test EER**         │ **2.94%**    │ **9.04%**         │ **+207%** ❌ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Root Cause Analysis:
• CPC loss dominated training (98.7% of total loss magnitude)
• Model overfitted to temporal smoothness rather than discrimination
• Severe generalization failure (0% validation → 9% test EER)

ATTEMPT B: OVERLAPPING WINDOWS (Boundary Smoothing)

Implementation:
• Window size: 8, stride: 4 (50% overlap)
• Weighted voting to merge overlapping predictions
• Objective: Reduce boundary discontinuities through soft windowing

Results:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Metric               │ Window TopK  │ Overlapping      │ Change        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Discontinuity Score  │ 11.9%        │ 7.2%             │ -39%          │
│ Boundary Jaccard     │ 82.3%        │ ~88%             │ +7% (est.)    │
│ **Test EER**         │ **2.94%**    │ **7.22%**        │ **+145%** ❌  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Why This Failed:
• Overlapping smooths ALL features, including discriminative ones
• Discriminative features are 26% more transient than non-discriminative
• Extending their activation duration dilutes discriminative signal

PART 3: CORE INSIGHT - THE STABILITY-DISCRIMINATION TRADE-OFF
================================================================================

The consistent pattern across both attempts reveals a fundamental trade-off:

KEY MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING:

Why discriminative features are transient:
• Deepfake artifacts are often localized in time (pitch glitches, boundary artifacts)
• Brief activations capture these transient anomalies effectively
• Persistent features would average over both artifact and clean regions

Why 97-98% subspace overlap despite transience:
• Coordinated activation patterns: features activate in consistent combinations
• The *set* of active features remains stable even as individual features turn on/off
• This is analogous to ensemble models where individual weak learners change but the ensemble prediction is stable

Why window-based TopK succeeds:
• Structural constraint (window=8) provides mild temporal coherence
• But doesn't force individual feature persistence
• Allows discriminative features to remain brief while maintaining subspace stability

PART 4: POSITIONING AND NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

RESEARCH POSITIONING:

Rather than positioning this as "we couldn't improve performance," I believe the value lies in the diagnostic insights and understanding of the trade-off:

Primary Contributions:
1. Diagnostic Framework: Established metrics for evaluating temporal SAE decision cues
   • Subspace overlap (measures cue reuse)
   • Feature lifetime distribution (persistent vs. transient)
   • Boundary effects analysis (source of instability)

2. Empirical Evidence: Window-based TopK achieves near-optimal balance (97-98% consistency + 2.94% EER)
   • Through structural constraint, not explicit loss
   • Decision features naturally stabilize more than average features

3. Understanding Why Explicit Losses Fail:
   • CPC and overlapping windows both degrade performance
   • Discriminative features are inherently transient
   • Over-regularization destroys discriminative power

4. Design Principle for Future Work:
   • Structural constraints > explicit temporal losses
   • Let task learning naturally stabilize decision-relevant features
   • Preserve flexibility for transient discriminative features

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS FOR MEETING:

1. Research Framing:
   • Should we position this as a diagnostic/interpretability contribution?
   • Or continue exploring alternative regularization approaches?

2. Class-Specific Analysis:
   • Spoof samples show 98.6% vs. genuine 97.3% consistency
   • Is this pattern meaningful? Should we investigate why?

3. Feature Localization:
   • We know discriminative features are transient (10.87 timesteps ≈ 217ms)
   • Could we analyze temporal localization of these activations?
   • Do they correlate with known artifact locations?

4. Generalization:
   • The CPC model shows severe overfitting (Val 0% → Test 9%)
   • Does this reveal something fundamental about temporal overfitting in audio?

5. Publication Venue:
   • With this framing (diagnostic + trade-off discovery), would we target:
     - Interpretability-focused: ICLR, NeurIPS
     - Audio-focused: Interspeech, ICASSP
     - Security-focused: IEEE S&P, USENIX

P.S. One methodological note: The complementary analyses (5k-sample subspace analysis + 500-sample individual lifetime analysis) converge on consistent findings. Decision features have 10.22 timestep lifetime (subspace-level) vs. 10.87 timestep lifetime (individual-level), validating the measurement approach.
