Subject: Re: Temporal Feature Analysis - Completed Experimental Results

Dear Caren,

Thank you for the clear guidance. I completely agree that we should position this as an interpretability and analysis contribution rather than incremental engineering.

I'm pleased to report that I have completed the three analyses you requested. Here are the concrete findings:

================================================================================
1. DEFINING "GOOD" TEMPORAL SAE FEATURES
================================================================================

I've established a diagnostic framework with six quantitative metrics:

PERSISTENCE METRICS:
• Feature Lifetime: Duration a feature remains continuously active
• Transient Ratio: Proportion of ephemeral (1-frame) activations

COHERENCE METRICS:
• Jaccard Similarity: Frame-to-frame feature overlap
• Index Overlap: Consistency of selected feature indices
• Turnover Rate: Percentage of features changing per frame

FAILURE INDICATORS:
• Flipping Rate: Features toggling activation state
• Transient Spike Ratio: Noise activations without semantic meaning

These metrics allow us to quantify interpretability: features with longer lifetimes, higher coherence, and fewer transient spikes are more likely to correspond to meaningful acoustic patterns.

================================================================================
2. WINDOW-BASED TOP-K FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

I analyzed our window-based TopK model (w=8, k=128, EER=2.94%) and identified persistent failure modes despite the structural temporal constraint:

WINDOW TOPK (w=8) FAILURE MODES:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Metric                   Value        Interpretation           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Median Lifetime          16 frames    ~320ms persistence       │
│ Transient Ratio          17.6%        1 in 6 activations noise│
│ Flipping Rate            4.66/frame   3.6% features unstable   │
│ Jaccard Similarity       0.854        85% frame-to-frame stable│
│ Index Overlap            0.851        Moderate identity drift   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

KEY INSIGHT: Even with window constraints, ~18% of activations are transient spikes, and ~5 features per frame exhibit instability. This suggests that structural constraints alone cannot fully eliminate temporal noise.

================================================================================
3. CONTROLLED STUDY: TEMPORAL REGULARIZATION EFFECTS
================================================================================

I compared three levels of temporal regularization to understand how enforcing temporal consistency affects both feature semantics and discriminative power:

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

CRITICAL FINDINGS:

A. Per-timestep TopK (Baseline):
   • Best EER (2.80%) but highly volatile features
   • 60% of activations are transient spikes → uninterpretable
   • 40 features flip per frame → no semantic continuity

B. Window TopK (Structural Constraint):
   • Minimal EER degradation (+0.14%, acceptable trade-off)
   • 8x longer feature lifetimes (2→16 frames)
   • 88% reduction in flipping rate
   • 70% reduction in transient spikes
   → ACHIEVES BALANCE: interpretable yet discriminative

C. CPC Loss (Explicit Temporal Loss):
   • 3x worse EER (9.04%) → catastrophic performance loss
   • Root cause analysis (from training logs):
     * CPC loss (weight=0.5) dominates 98.7% of total loss
     * Model overfits to temporal predictability, not discrimination
     * Bonafide confidence drops from 0.98 to 0.81
   → OVER-REGULARIZATION: learns temporal smoothness but loses task-relevant features

TEMPORAL STABILITY ANALYSIS (In Progress):
I'm currently running the same diagnostic analysis on the CPC model to determine whether its poor performance is due to:
(a) Learning overly smooth but semantically meaningless features, or
(b) Learning interpretable features that happen to be poor for discrimination

This will complete the controlled study by showing how feature semantics qualitatively change as temporal consistency is enforced.

================================================================================
4. PROPOSED PAPER FRAMING
================================================================================

Based on these findings, I suggest positioning the paper as:

TITLE: "Understanding Temporal Dynamics in Sparse Audio Representations 
        for Deepfake Detection: A Diagnostic Framework"

CONTRIBUTIONS:
1. Diagnostic Framework: Establish quantitative metrics for evaluating temporal feature quality in sparse autoencoders

2. Failure Mode Analysis: Identify and characterize instability patterns (transient spikes, feature flipping, identity drift) in TopK SAE

3. Temporal-Discriminative Trade-off: Empirically demonstrate that:
   • No temporal constraint → volatile but discriminative (EER 2.80%)
   • Structural constraint → stable and discriminative (EER 2.94%)
   • Explicit loss → over-stable but non-discriminative (EER 9.04%)
   
   Showing there exists an optimal balance for interpretability

4. Architectural Insight: Window-based TopK achieves near-optimal trade-off through structural inductive bias rather than explicit loss

KEY MESSAGE: The contribution is not "adding CPC improves performance" but rather "systematic analysis reveals that temporal stability and discriminative power can be balanced through carefully designed architectural constraints, not just loss functions."

5. DISCUSSION QUESTIONS FOR FRIDAY
================================================================================

1. Feature Semantics: Should we add qualitative analysis (e.g., which features correspond to which artifacts)? Or keep it quantitative?

2. Temporal Dynamics Hypothesis: Our results suggest that deepfake artifacts may have different temporal signatures than bonafide speech. Should we explicitly test this?

3. Generalization: The CPC model overfits dramatically (Val EER 0.0% → Test EER 9.04%). Does this reveal something fundamental about temporal overfitting in audio?

4. Paper Venue: With this framing, should we target an interpretability-focused venue (e.g., ICLR, NeurIPS) or audio-focused (Interspeech, ICASSP)?

I have all analysis results, visualizations, and detailed breakdowns ready for our meeting. The CPC temporal stability analysis should complete within 1-2 hours, giving us the complete picture.

Please let me know if you'd like me to prepare any additional analyses before Friday.

Best regards,
Nick
