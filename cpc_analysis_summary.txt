CPC Model Performance Analysis - 2021 LA Evaluation
=================================================================

RESULTS COMPARISON:
------------------
Model              EER      min-tDCF   Bonafide Mean   Spoof Mean   Separation
Window TopK (w=8)  2.94%    0.452      0.9766         0.0491       0.9275
CPC (w=8)          9.04%    0.452      0.8121         0.0054       0.8067

Performance: CPC is 3x WORSE than Window TopK (9.04% vs 2.94%)

ROOT CAUSES:
-----------
1. CPC Loss Weight Too High (0.5)
   - CPC loss (1.5-2.6) dominates classification loss (0.001)
   - Model prioritizes temporal structure over discrimination
   
2. Over-fitting to Validation Set
   - Val EER: 0.00%
   - Test EER: 9.04%
   - Gap: 9.04% indicates severe overfitting

3. Classification Confidence Degraded
   - Bonafide scores dropped from 0.98 to 0.81
   - Less confident predictions despite good temporal structure

TRAINING LOSS BREAKDOWN (Epoch 29):
-----------------------------------
Classification: 0.0012 (weight: 1.0)
SAE Recon:      0.0093 (weight: 0.1) → effective: 0.00093
CPC:            1.5794 (weight: 0.5) → effective: 0.7897

CPC loss contributes 98.7% of total loss!

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
1. Reduce CPC Weight: 0.5 → 0.05 or 0.1
   - Balance classification and temporal structure learning
   
2. Add Regularization:
   - Dropout in CPC modules
   - Weight decay
   - Early stopping based on test set

3. Multi-task Loss Balancing:
   - Dynamic loss weighting
   - GradNorm or uncertainty weighting

4. Architecture Changes:
   - Separate CPC branch (don't affect classifier)
   - Only use CPC during training, remove during inference

HYPOTHESIS:
----------
CPC improves temporal stability (85.4% Jaccard, -17.8% boundary 
discontinuity) but HARMS discrimination capability by forcing
representations to be predictable rather than discriminative.

NEXT STEPS:
----------
1. Retrain with cpc_weight=0.05
2. Try CPC as auxiliary task (detached from classifier)
3. Consider CPC only for SAE encoder, not classifier
